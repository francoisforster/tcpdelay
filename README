TCPDelay is a simple TCP tunnel, written in java with no other dependencies, that can add a specified delay to each packet.

It can be used to test the behavior of dependencies, such as services in a SOA world, with regards to delays or timeouts, as well as severed connections and retry logic, without having to modify the dependency.

Simply start TCPDelay, configured to point to the destination and with the appropriate delay, and the source application configured to point to TCPDelay. To test a severed connection simply kill TCPDelay and to test retry logic simply restart TCPDelay.

To run TCPDelay:

java org.tcpdelay.Launcher [-help] [-logLevel {DEBUG|INFO|ERROR}] [-delayMs <ms delay>] -localPort <port> -remoteHost <hostname> -remotePort <port>

Note: the delay applies to both outgoing and incoming communication, so a roundtrip will be slower by twice the delay.
